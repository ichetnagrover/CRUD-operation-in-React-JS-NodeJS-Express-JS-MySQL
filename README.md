This project showcases a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation implementation using React JS, Node.js, Express JS, and MySQL. It manages multiple records and provides functionalities to Create, Read, Update, and Delete records.

## Functionality
- **CREATE:** Allows users to add new records.
- **READ:** Enables viewing existing records.
- **DELETE:** Provides the ability to remove unwanted records.
- **UPDATE:** Allows modification of existing records.

    ```
    cd Client
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the application in development mode:**
    ```
    npm start
    ```

4. **Access the application:**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Backend

    ```

**Note:** Ensure that your MySQL server is properly configured and connected for the application to function correctly.

## Database Configuration
Ensure your MySQL database configuration is updated in the project files to establish a proper connection between the backend and the MySQL server.

## Additional Notes
- Make sure to maintain the necessary environment variables and configurations for both frontend and backend environments.
- Troubleshoot any connection or dependency issues by checking the logs or error messages displayed in the console.
